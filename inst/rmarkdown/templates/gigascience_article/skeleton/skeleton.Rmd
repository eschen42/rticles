# Instructions to Authors

There are two contradictory suggested TeX formats; this template is based on the former, which is can also be used online at Overleaf.  The Overleaf template is based on oup-contemporary.cls and dates from 2017, whereas the download-only template is based gbe.cls and dates from 2008.

## Submission through Overleaf
For creating manuscripts in LaTeX, Gigascience recommends the use of its own LaTeX class files. Our class files are available online at Overleaf and also as a downloadable package via the links below.

Overleaf is a free, collaborative online LaTeX editor that allows you to write your manuscript in a TeX or rich text environment, to generate PDF outputs as you write, and to share your manuscript with co-authors and collaborators. When ready for submission, the manuscript files can be downloaded from Overleaf and submitted to the journal’s online submission system.

[Overleaf Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-gigascience-journal-manuscript-submissions/shgtrssvbjhs)

## Additional information for TeX/LaTeX users

Please use [OUP’s TeX template and BibTeX stylefile](https://academic.oup.com/DocumentLibrary/GigaScience/GIGSCI%20TeX%20template.zip) if you use TeX format. When submitting TeX submissions, please submit your TeX file as the main manuscript file and your bib/bbl file as a dependent file. Please also convert your TeX file into a PDF and submit this PDF as an additional file with the name 'Reference PDF'. This PDF will be used by our production team as a reference point to check the layout of the article as the author intended. Please also note that all figures must be coded at the end of the TeX file and not inline.

All relevant editable source files must be uploaded during the submission process. Failing to submit these source files will cause unnecessary delays in the production process.
